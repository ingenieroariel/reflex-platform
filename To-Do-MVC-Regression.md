## Test Plan for Reflex-Platform
```
mkdir rp-sandbox
cd rp-sandbox
git clone git@github.com:reflex-frp/reflex-platform.git
cd reflex-platform
git checkout <git commit that you are testing>
```
### Making sure that the try-reflex shell works
```
./try-reflex
```
Copy the following into the shell (all at once):
```
cat >hello.hs <<EOF
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Reflex.Dom
main = mainWidget $ text "Hello, world!"
EOF
```
```
ghc hello.hs
./hello
```
A successful build looks like this:
[pic here]

```
ghcjs hello.hs
chromium hello.jsexe/index.html
```

### Running a build on the web
```
nix-build -A ghcjs.reflex-todomvc
```
If successful this will give you a file path. Navigate to a browswer (like chrome) and enter the following (with the path) into the bar:
```
file:///<insert path from previous instruction here>/bin/reflex-todomvc.jsexe/index.html
```
You should test this app. 

### Android App:
```
nix-build release.nix -A x86_64-linux.androidReflexTodomvc
```
Use the line generated by the command above to run the next command
Make sure that your android device has been plugged in, that you have deleted any app titled "reflex-todomvc" from the phone, and that you have unlocked and accepted permissions on the phone before running the following:
```
<path from command above>/bin/deploy
```

### Removing the sandbox dir:
```
cd ../../
rm -rf rp-sandbox
```


### Testing TODOMVC app on IOS

### Testing the 'work-on-multi' script

### Testing that reflex-platform works in lithograph
The purpose of this test is to ensure that we can smoothly bump reflex platform inside of the latest version of obelisk apps
